# cub3D
This is the second graphic project at [42](42sp.org.br), our first RayCaster with miniLibX.

### What is cub3D?
Cub3D is a team project at [42](42sp.org.br) that requires us to create a "3D" game with miniLibX. This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.
